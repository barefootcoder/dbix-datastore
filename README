DO NOT USE THIS CODE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING.

We are in the process of turning this into something useful.  Until then, it isn't, in the general
case.  It won't make, it won't test, and it certainly won't install.  But at least it's here for you
if you really need it.

Until such time as a formal license is attached, please consider this code to be released under the
